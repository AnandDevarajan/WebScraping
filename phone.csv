Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max (64GB) - Midnight Green






","4.5 out of 5LongevityBattery lifeCamera qualityValue for moneyWrite a product review","The triple cameras on the iPhone 11 Pro Max now give Apple the best camera phone, thanks to its great Night mode and improved Smart HDR,a huge improvement in battery life Up to 20 hours video playback; up to 12 hours video streaming ... Apple's slow-motion selfies are fun at 120 fps.Apple has given the Pro moniker to the iPhones for the first time. Everything is improved and everything feels better.It comes with a new Lightning to USB Cable with 5W USB Power Adapter.With Display of 6.5-inch Super Retina XDR display with HDR,True Tone, Splash, Water, and Dust Resistant, Water-resistant to a depth of 4 meters for up to 30 minutes (IP68)), Triple 12MP cameras (Ultra Wide, Wide, Telephoto) with Portrait mode, Night mode, Auto Adjustments, next-generation Smart HDR and 4K video up to 60 fps with extended dynamic range.I pre ordered the item on sept 21 and received ok 2 Oct . It was in iOS 13 . It is buttery smooth and nice and there was an update of ios13.1.2 available. But after updating I stuck in Apple logo. I could not create a return in Amazon as it's asked me to contact Apple. I wonder why is that.Decent packaging and shipping üëç Upgraded from an iPhone X and I reckon its definitely worth it üòä Size matters, no pun intended, and you can instantly feel the difference b/w a 5.7 inch screen and a 6.5 inch ü§ì If you have an iPhone X or earlier model, you should definitely consider upgrading. For iPhone XS Max, you are better off waiting for next year model as its touted to undergo some radical changes (5G, USB-C, Touch ID comeback and notch less design perhaps). No 5G in this model but doesn't make a difference, at least in India, as even the 5G spectrum has not been auctioned yet üòù  WiFi performance is better than iPhone X as this model supports 11ax protocol ü§ó And by the way, if you are stuck for choice b/w Gold and Midnight Green, go for Gold and thank me later ‚ú®¬†11 Pro Max 256 GB phone hanged last 12 hours continuesi LOST MY KIDNEYS.I was using iPhone XS Max, but now after having iPhone 11 Pro Max - I can say it is fabulous and outstanding. Perfect as always, performance is too good.Night mode is better than any available camera, Pixel 4 XL, Mate 30 Pro and Note 10+.This device is unbeatable (until next iPhone).I will rate one start for this product. My experience of using this phone for one week is sub-par, multiple times in this one week this phone hanged. Many time even home screen was hanged( i have installed only five additional apps quora, amazon, facebook, whatsapp and google maps). Please refrain from purchasing this phone. It is waste of money.In love with it","64 GBMidnight Green","‚Çπ¬†1,17,100.00
